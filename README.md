# Dataflow Architecture Documentation

## Overview

This documentation outlines the architecture and data flow design for moving data from a web server to a data server using various AWS services. The architecture is designed to be scalable, secure, and flexible, catering to a diverse range of data types and processing needs.

## Components

### 1. EC2 Instance (Web Server)

The EC2 instance serves as the web server where the initial data is generated or collected.

### 2. Amazon S3 Bucket

Amazon S3 (Simple Storage Service) is used as a highly scalable storage solution for the raw data collected from the EC2 instance. Data is securely stored in S3 buckets, ensuring durability and availability.

### 3. Amazon RDS Database

Amazon RDS (Relational Database Service) is utilized as the primary database storage solution. The raw data stored in S3 is processed and loaded into the RDS database, providing structured and queryable data storage.

### 4. Read Replica

A read replica of the RDS database is created to offload read queries and distribute read traffic, enhancing performance and scalability.

### 5. Additional EC2 Instances

Additional EC2 instances can be deployed to access and utilize the data stored in RDS, providing flexibility in data processing and analysis.
